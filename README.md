# The Quack Council 🦆

**Hack Western '25 Project**

## 🎙️ What is this?
The Quack Council is an interactive AI-powered support group ... composed entirely of ducks. 

Motivated by the software engineering technique of **[Rubber Duck Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)**, this project takes the concept of explaining your problems to an inanimate object to the next level. Instead of a silent yellow bath toy, you get 5 distinct personalities—from the rage-filled Gordon (Ramsay) to the existential Blues—who not only listen but debate your problems, talk back, and offer their unique "expert" opinions.

Whether you are debugging a complex recursive function or just need to vent about life, the Council is in session.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, Lucide UI
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python
- **AI**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (Reasoning/Text Generation)
- **Voice**: ElevenLabs (Text-to-Speech)

## 🚀 Features
- **Multi-Agent Debate**: Ducks converse with each other and you, maintaining context and memory.
- **Two Modes**:
  - **Therapy Chat**: A warm, safe space for emotional support.
  - **Rubber Duck Debugger**: A hacker-themed interface for technical walkthroughs.
- **Interactive**: Poke individual ducks to solicit specific feedback.
- **Dynamic Audio**: Real-time generated voices with lip-sync visualization.

## 🦆 The Ducks
1. **Gordon (Red)**: Angry, perfectionist, yells like a chef.
2. **Joy (Yellow)**: Unbearably optimistic.
3. **Blues (Blue)**: Existential dread personified.
4. **Dexter (Green)**: The "Actually..." nerd.
5. **Goose (Orange)**: Pure chaos agent.
